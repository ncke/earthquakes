     Queries the USGS earthquake service for a collection of events.

     - Parameter startDate: The date from which to start the collection.
     - Parameter minMagnitude: The minimum seismic magnitude for inclusion
     in the collection, if you pass nil then all available events are
     included.
     - Parameter completion: A function to call to handle the result once
     the query has finished. The function must accept a single parameter
     which is a Result type that holds the received FeatureCollection in
     the event of success, or an error in the event of failure.
